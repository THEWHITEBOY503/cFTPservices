Get 5 GB free when you sign up!

## The cFTP services Discord
The gathering place for cFTP services.

### Getting extra storage on cFTP
Be active in the Discord server. Taso is in the server. Every 5 levels, you get an extra GB of storage.

### The signing up process
Once you are in the server and you ask to join cFTP services, I'll DM you some questions and stuff and if I think you are worthy of my FTP server (which I probably will, fear not) I will ask you to provide me with a username and password. I advise you use a password different and not relating to the password you use for everything (if you're that type of person).

### Joining the server
The link for joining is at the top of the page. Or you can just go [here](https://discord.gg/5BP5UnT) if you don't feel like scrolling up

## Alternate methods of signing up

*please note, if you use these methods to sign up, you will not be able to gain extra storage.*

### Google Forms
If you cannot join the discord server, we have a [Google Forms](https://goo.gl/forms/Y3PiZ87OPPtrYMyl2) for signing up.

### E-mail
Another method is asking for an invite via email. If you would like to do this, E-mail cftpservices@gmail.com to get started.
