## What is cFTP services?
cFTP services stands for "Conner File Transfer Protocol services". cFTP Services is the first service offered by cServices.

### What is FTP?
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a method of downloading and uploading files. Think of it like sending a letter to your friend, but its much faster and you're sending files and not paper.

### What makes cFTP services so different?
It's an FTP service, with all the work behind the scenes done by a real person and not an automated bot. It's also completely free to use.

### What do you host cFTP services on?
I host it on my Dell PowerEdge 2850 using FileZilla. I have a stable connection and a stable computer, so don't worry about the server dying. And if the server somehow goes down, I'll be quick to get it back on its feet (That is, unless I'm asleep...)

### What do you do with cFTP services?
You can upload any file to it and have your friend connect to a read only version of your account to download the file. You can store up to 5 GB of files.

## The cFTP services Discord
The gathering place for cFTP services.

### Getting extra storage on cFTP
Be active in the Discord server. Taso is in the server. Every 2 levels, you get an extra GB of storage.

### The signing up process
Once you are in the server and you ask to join cFTP services, I'll DM you some questions and stuff and if I think you are worthy of my FTP server (Which I probably will, fear not) I will ask you to provide me with a username and password. I advise you use a password different and not relating to the password you use for everything (If you're that type of person).

### Joining the server
The link for joining is at the top of the page. Or you can just go [here](https://discord.gg/5BP5UnT) if you don't feel like scrolling up

## Alternate methods of signing up

**please note, if you use these methods to sign up, you will not be able to gain extra storage.**

### Google Forms
If you cannot join the discord server, we have a [Google Forms](https://goo.gl/forms/Y3PiZ87OPPtrYMyl2) for signing up.

### E-mail
Another method is asking for an account via email. If you would like to do this, E-mail cftpservices@gmail.com to get started. The application questions may vary using this method

## cFTP public access
If you would like to try out cFTP or just send someone a file over FTP, cFTP offers a public access program. It can store up to 1.37 GB total and is cleared out daily. **Note that anyone can log into cFTP public access, so make sure you do NOT upload anything private or important.**
To get in to cFTP public access,

hostname: cservices.ddns.net

username: publicaccess

password: cftppublicaccess
